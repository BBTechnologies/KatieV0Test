# Dialogs

## Notes about implementation

To make a dialog component accessible and compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), several requirements and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes need to be implemented. Below is a summary of how the dialog implementation meets the criteria.

### WCAG Requirement: Perceivable
Focus is given to the dialog when it opens, ensuring it's clearly visible to screen readers and keyboard users.

##### Keyboard navigation:
The dialog can be opened, closed, and navigated via keyboard (WCAG 2.1.1).
The dialog can be closed via the Escape key (WCAG 2.1.2).

Focus is contained inside the dialog so keyboard users can only interact with the dialog while it's open. Interactive elements within the dialog are navigable using Tab and Shift + Tab.
The header, content and footer elements are all tabbable and focusable by keyboard.
If the user manages to move the focus elsewhere in the dom, for instance by clicking on the address bar and tabbing back into the dom, the dialog will close itself.

### WCAG Requirement: Understandable

##### Clear labeling:
The header property is a required property. This ensures the dialog has a clear heading that describes its purpose (WCAG 3.3.2).

The dialog close button has type="button", a title attribute that shows 'Open and close dialog' on hover, and a screen reader friendly label of 'Close dialog'. (WCAG 2.4.6)
The 'x' icon only adds presentational value so is hidden from screen readers via role="presentation" aria-hidden="true".

#### ARIA Attributes
The wrapping dialog element has the following aria properties;

- ```role="dialog"```
- ```aria-labelledby``` - this points at the dialog header element.
- ```aria-describedby``` - this points at a hidden screen reader instruction at the start of the dialog which reads "The following content is in a dialog.
You can press the Tab key to navigate through the elements, and press Escape to close the dialog.".
- ```aria-modal="true"```

A very basic example of a dialog is below. The intention is that the open and close state is managed by a parent component that hosts it.

```
const [dialogIsOpen, setDialogIsOpen] = useState(true);

<Dialog {
  ...{
    id: 'Demo1',
    header: 'This is a header',
    footer: 'This is the footer',
    onClose: () => setDialogIsOpen(false),
    open: dialogIsOpen
  }
}
>
  This is the content
</Dialog>
```
<ArgTypes of={Dialog} />

It creates the following dom elements;
```
<div class="dialog isOpen dialogSize_m dialogPosition_center dialogAnimation_none dialogScrollBehaviour_contentAndFooter" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialogHeader_Demo1" tabindex="0" aria-describedby="dialogSRInstruction_Demo1" aria-modal="true">
  <button class="dialogClose" title="Open and close dialog" type="button">
    <i class="icon icon-cross" role="presentation" aria-hidden="true" />
    <span class="sr-only">Close dialog </span>
  </button>

  <div class="dialogFullScroller">
    <div id="dialogHeader_Demo1" class="dialogHeader" tabindex="0">
      <span id="dialogSRInstruction_Demo1" class="sr-only">The following content is in a dialog. You can press the Tab key to navigate through the elements, and press Escape to close the dialog. </span>
      <span class="dialogHeaderText">This is a header</span>
    </div>
    <div class="dialogContentAndFooterScroller">
      <section class="dialogContent" tabindex="0">This is the content</section>
      <div class="dialogFooter" tabindex="0">
        <span class="dialogFooterText">This is the footer</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And controls or adds a dialogOverlay element (appended to the body element).
```
<div class="dialogOverlay isVisible" id="dialogOverlay"></div>
```
