# Known Issues

The component library is a work in progress and will evolve over time. The following is a list of known issues that will be addressed in future releases.

## Styling
Yep. The styling needs a lot of work. We have a new dedicated visual designer joining the team who will work with each of the Venture in-house designers, front end specialists and anyone else with an interest to develop a design system and uplift the components over time.

## Accessibility

### Accordions
The library currently does not have a multi-accordion component.
Note: If you wish to use multiple accordions grouped together it will be necessary to also support;
1. Arrow key navigation between the accordion headers. (WCAG 2.1.2)
2. Home/End keys (optional): These keys can jump to the first or last accordion header.
