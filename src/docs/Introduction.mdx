# Introduction

## Getting started

Welcome to the x15 UI Component Library. Whether you're a designer or a developer, this guide will help you get started and connect you to the essential resources you need.

We're building our own design system to create an experience that works for all our customers while providing developers with the simplicity and efficiency of modern UI libraries.
This approach prioritises accessibility, semantic correctness, and adaptability across use cases, enabling faster innovation and more consistent outcomes for ALL our customers.

While this is additional work, the long-term benefits in quality, agility and customer outcomes, make it a worthwhile investment.

## Development Resources

### Design System Structure

Plan Components: Identify the atomic design structure: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms.

- Atoms: Basic UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Checkbox).
- Molecules: Combinations of Atoms (e.g., Form, Card).
- Organisms: Higher-level components (e.g., Navbar, Footer).

### Coding Standards

Maintaining a consistent code style is essential for collaborative development. Our coding standards document will guide you on best practices.

### Version Control

We use Git for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and are familiar with its basics.

### Development Tools

Your development environment is critical. Here are some tools and resources to help you set up your workspace:

- **Code Editor**: Most x15 Ventures engineers use either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for development. Both are highly customizable and support a wide range of extensions. WebStorm requires approval from your Venture Technology lead in order to procure a licence. You will also need to request admin privileges to install on your system. For more information on engineering please refer to the [x15 Handbook](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/join/eyJnIjoiT0lEOjQzZDFjMjIxLTI0MGEtNDJlNi1iZDU2LTU4Y2Q0M2MzYjk5MkA2ZjZkYTAzMS1lNWNmLTRlNjItODJjZC05NjYzNmU4MDYzOWUiLCJpIjoiMEpEVkJwcXBJRWVteXR4UTJOZ2xRIiwidyI6IlQwUlRVSHg0TVRVdWMyaGhjbVZ3YjJsdWRDNWpiMjE4WWlGWU1WOXdXa1poTkZjd0xUVnNUQzFwY0VKNlpFMUZVVk52Y25aRmVURTVSR2RZYVd4eU5qUkROR1U1YmxRd1RVRnJUV3hpVVdJNVUzRjVWMTlET1RWemZEQXhNMU5ZUWtoYVNrUldSMDFXTWs1UlVWWkdTRnBMUjAxWlEwbERTREpWV2pVPSJ9) on Loop.

- **Package Manager**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is the package manager we use for TurboRepo projects. Install it to manage project dependencies.
